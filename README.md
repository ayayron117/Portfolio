Welcome! My name is Aaron, I'm a bioinformatician who analyzes NGS data for users of the Innovative Genomics & Bioinformatics Core facility (<a href="https://my.creighton.edu/researchservices/corefacilities/innovativegenomicsbioinformaticscore/">IGBC</a>) within the Lynch Cancer Research Center (<a href="https://www.creighton.edu/medicine/research/research-centers-and-institutes/lynch-comprehensive-cancer-research-center">LCRC</a>) at Creighton University. I've held this position since October 3rd, 2022. My degrees include an MS degree in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology and a BS degree in Physics with a minor in Chemistry, both from the University of South Florida.
