# Aaron S. Mohammed - Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Aaron! Holding a Master of Science degree in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology and a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics with a minor in Chemistry from the University of South Florida, I have a multidisciplinary background in the natural sciences. Since October 3rd 2022, I have managed the Innovative Genomics & Bioinformatics Core (IGBC) in the Lynch Comprehensive Cancer Research Center (LCCRC) of Creighton University. My primary responsibility is to fulfill all NGS data analysis service requests from users of the IGBC. This includes RNA seq, scRNA seq, and WGS data analysis. From August 2020 - October 2021, I worked as an IT research assistant at USF. That role involved assisting research labs with programming tasks.

Displayed below are summaries of projects I have worked on over the past 3 years. These summaries contain links to repositories that contain markdown files that provide more details on these projects and showcase code I wrote.

## *C.elegan* Aging Atlas
**Code:**  
**Paper:**  
**Description:** The purpose of this project was to build a transcriptomic aging atlas that could be used to investigate and compare the age related changes associated with some of these mechanisms at the cellular level. Single nucleus RNA sequencing was utilized to capture the transcriptomes of worms that were subjected to the pro-longevity mechanisms. Nuclei from cells in various tissues were sequenced on certain days to track the transcriptomic changes that occurred as the worms aged. My contributions to this project include the following:

- Aging-clocks for all tissues
- Tissue-specific age prediction and correlations for wild type and long-lived strains
- Weighted gene co-expression network analysis to determine module eigengenes, consensus modules, and module trait correlations
- Gene set enrichment analysis
- RShiny app for exploration of the transcriptomic aging atlas
