## About
<div align='justify'>
Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a bioinformatician with about 1 year of experience and over 4 years of programming experience. I created this to showcase some of my work over the past few years. I graduated with my master's degree in Fall of 2022 from the University of South Florida (USF). Since October 3rd 2022, I manage the Innovative Genomics & Bioinformatics Core (IGBC) in the Lynch Comprehensive Cancer Research Center (LCCRC) of Creighton University. My primary responsibility is to fulfill all NGS data analysis service requests for users of the IGBC. These data analysis services include RNA seq, scRNA seq, and WGS data analysis. In the past, I worked as an IT research assistant at USF from August 2020 - October 2021. That role involved assisting research labs with various programming tasks. Here are the degrees I have:

## *C.elegan* Aging Atlas
**Code:**  
**Paper:**  
**Description:** The purpose of this project was to build a transcriptomic aging atlas that could be used to investigate and compare the age related changes associated with some of these mechanisms at the cellular level. Single nucleus RNA sequencing was utilized to capture the transcriptomes of worms that were subjected to the pro-longevity mechanisms. Nuclei from cells in various tissues were sequenced on certain days to track the transcriptomic changes that occurred as the worms aged. My contributions to this project include the following:

- Aging-clocks for all tissues
- Tissue-specific age prediction and correlations for wild type and long-lived strains
- Weighted gene co-expression network analysis to determine module eigengenes, consensus modules, and module trait correlations
- Gene enrichment analysis
- RShiny app for exploration of the transcriptomic aging atlas
